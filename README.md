## Overview

Coral seamlessly integrates with Nautilus to provide quick access to common developer tasks directly from the file manager's context menu. No more switching between applications or remembering complex terminal commands - everything you need is just a right-click away.

### âš¡ Run Script
**Available:** On shell script files (.sh)

Executes shell scripts in a new terminal window, complete with proper directory context and user-friendly output.
